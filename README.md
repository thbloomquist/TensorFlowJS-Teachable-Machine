To run this repository, download it onto your local machine and set up a local server. 
To set up a local server, I recommend downloading PHP (brew install php) and inputting "sudo php -S localhost:8000" into the terminal in the Teachable-Machine directory.

It will take a few seconds to train the model and then it will begin running.
